print("I think using version control software becomes essential as soon as the project youâ€™re working on grows beyond you. If a project gets big enough that a 2nd person is deemed necessary then version control becomes instantly beneficial. The biggest benefit is the way git allows you to communicate changes and intent inherently without having to keep up constant 1-on-1 communication. Viewing the code changes and commit messages enable you to understand exactly what work your partner has done and for what reason that work was done. Because of this, work can be done in different timezones, countries, or opposite shifts without difficulty. Another advantage comes from the logging of all of these changes. Keeping track of every change allows you to look back at any point in the development process. This is useful when tracing where broken code started, trying to determine the reason why a piece of code written a long time ago was written, or just simply providing more context when developing specific related features. Additionally, git branching allows you to play around with and test different pieces of code without affecting the main code branch. You can test and experiment as much as you want and then you can decide if and when to merge your branch into the main branch. This also prevents other people that you're working with from having to work around someone else's unfinished code.Everyone can work off of their own branch and nothing gets merged to the main branch until complete.\n")
